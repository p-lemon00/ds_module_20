## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    *  Test metrics accuracy score : AUC: 0.9963734527426835
    *  Weighted average: .99 across the board for f1 score, precision and recall
    *  Macro accuracy: .94 for precision, .97 for recall, .95 for f1 score



## Summary


The logistic model has a high accuracy for both healthy and high risk loans. The healthy loan prediction is better at near perfect. Whereas the high risk prediction had a higher occurance of inaccurate predictions. This might be because the number of high risk loans in the test data set was much lower at 625 compared to the 18759 healthy loans, which may have allowed the larger data sample for the healthy loans to create more accurate prediction.
I think the most important is to correctly predict the 1s to correctly identify those at risk because are the loans that need to be looked at and perhaps need to reach out to the borrower about. To conclude I would recommend this model it has a very high degree of accuracy.
